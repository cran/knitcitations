v0.3-1
------

* Switched to handling citation data using environment rather than an external bibfile.
  This does not refer to the handling of user-provided bibtex files as input data,
  which are supported as before, but changes only the backend management of that data.
  The external bibtex file method can be switched back on by setting 
  `options("bibtex_data" = TRUE)`.  
* There is no need to call `print(bibliography, "html")`, one can simply call 
  `bibliography()` or `bibliography("html")`. Sort is still an option, other 
  options that were for internal use (`debug`, `remove_duplicates`) are 
  removed as they are no longer necessary.  
* Several new functions have been added to handle the new methods.
