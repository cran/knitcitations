* keep each function in separate file

v0.4-0
------

### Major changes

* Support for citations by URL.  Paste the full URL of any academic
  journal or other webpage.  Uses the Greycite API 
* Introduces linked inline citations as an option (previously active
  only for CITO links).  Inline citation text will be linked directly
  to the article by DOI or URL.  Toggle on or off using cite_options
  globally, or passing `linked=FALSE` to the calls to `citet` or `citep`
* Introduces tooltips option. Mouse over an inline citation and see
  the full citation information.  * Introduces `cite_options`, to toggle
  certain settings such as tooltips, linked inline text,


### Minor changes

* in-line link will use URL if a DOI is not found
* `cite` is now exported to the namespace.  Useful to return a bibentry object given a DOI or URL.  


v0.3-5
------

* Fix formatting of parenthetical citations (bug introduced previously converted these to citet format)
* Additional documentation
* Install instructions for development version added to README

v0.3-4
------

* Avoid dropped citations caused by redundant key collisions, closes #21




v0.3-3
------

* Added a new display option, `bibliography('markdown')`
* fixed BUG in the printing of the text-based name in bibliography for bibstyle-based calls

v0.3-2
------

* Semantic citations now enabled.  `bibliography` can print with method 'rdfa'
  to provide RDFa enhanced HTML bibliography data, and citations can take cito
  arguments as an option. (Closes issues #16 and #17)
* `bibliography` now takes more options to match the `bibstyle` and `print.bibentry`
  functions.
* `citet` and `citep` take an optional argument for formating the citation, defaulting
  to `authoryear` format.  Future versions may move this into an option.  
* `newbib()` function initializes and clears existing cache files.  
* README.md updated with semantic examples and more background text (generated by 
  inst/examples/README.Rmd). 
* Some basic unit tests built in.  Could use more, but meanwhile closes #8.
* Test cases work with knit2html button in RStudio, closes #14

v0.3-1
------

* Switched to handling citation data using environment rather than an external bibfile.
  This does not refer to the handling of user-provided bibtex files as input data,
  which are supported as before, but changes only the backend management of that data.
  The external bibtex file method can be switched back on by setting 
  `options("bibtex_data" = TRUE)`.  
* There is no need to call `print(bibliography, "html")`, one can simply call 
  `bibliography()` or `bibliography("html")`. Sort is still an option, other 
  options that were for internal use (`debug`, `remove_duplicates`) are 
  removed as they are no longer necessary.  
* Several new functions have been added to handle the new methods.  


v0.2-0
------

* Fix vignette error that prevents knitr 1.0 submission
* Fixed errors on installing package and lack of entries in bibliography
* Semantic print option added but still in early testing 

v0.1-0
------

* `bibliography()` now takes style as an option (html, text, bibtex output)
* imports write.bib from pkgmaker package instead of from doRNG
* URL in description on CRAN

v0.0-2
------

* Initial Release
