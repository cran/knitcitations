v0.3-2
------

* Semantic citations now enabled.  `bibliography` can print with method 'rdfa'
  to provide RDFa enhanced HTML bibliography data, and citations can take cito
  arguments as an option. (Closes issues #16 and #17)
* `bibliography` now takes more options to match the `bibstyle` and `print.bibentry`
  functions.
* `citet` and `citep` take an optional argument for formating the citation, defaulting
  to `authoryear` format.  Future versions may move this into an option.  
* `newbib()` function initializes and clears existing cache files.  
* README.md updated with semantic examples and more background text (generated by 
  inst/examples/README.Rmd). 
* Some basic unit tests built in.  Could use more, but meanwhile closes #8.
* Test cases work with knit2html button in RStudio, closes #14

v0.3-1
------

* Switched to handling citation data using environment rather than an external bibfile.
  This does not refer to the handling of user-provided bibtex files as input data,
  which are supported as before, but changes only the backend management of that data.
  The external bibtex file method can be switched back on by setting 
  `options("bibtex_data" = TRUE)`.  
* There is no need to call `print(bibliography, "html")`, one can simply call 
  `bibliography()` or `bibliography("html")`. Sort is still an option, other 
  options that were for internal use (`debug`, `remove_duplicates`) are 
  removed as they are no longer necessary.  
* Several new functions have been added to handle the new methods.
